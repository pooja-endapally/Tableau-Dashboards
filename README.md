📊 Tableau Dashboards

Welcome to the Tableau Dashboards repository! This project showcases interactive data visualizations and analytics dashboards that I created as part of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and self-driven practice.

Each workbook demonstrates data storytelling, exploratory analysis, and insights derived using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.

🧠 About This Project

Tableau is a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool that helps transform raw data into actionable insights. In this repository, you’ll find dashboards built to:

Visualize trends and patterns

Compare metrics across categories

Tell data-driven stories

Support decision-making with clarity

These dashboards reflect real-world data challenges and solutions — a core part of building a professional analytics portfolio.

📁 What’s Inside

Each folder or file in this repository contains:

📊 Tableau Workbook (.twbx) — The interactive dashboard

📄 Dataset (optional) — Source data used in the dashboard

📝 Documentation (if available) — Notes or explanation of insights

Tip: You can include exported PNG screenshots of your dashboards in this README to give quick visual context before someone opens the workbook.
